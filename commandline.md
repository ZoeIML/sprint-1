The command line is the inside of your computer but organised in words rather than images. For example, you use text commands to navigate to s folder such as Documents. You can then use text commands to move between folders or files within the Documents folder, which is the same as when you click through them in Finder. 

1. pwd - tells you what area of the computer you are in, like a GPS telling you where you are on a map
2. mkdir - makes a new folder, which is known as a directory
3. cd - lets you change folders, a bit like a home button on a phone: it brings you to a neutral place and then you can go where you need to by typing in the folder you're looking for 
4. ls - this lists the folders that are in the area you are in, it's like another navigation tool that a map might use, giving you landmarks so you know what's in the area and where you might want to go
5. rmdir - the opposite to mkdir, this deletes a folder
6. cp - copy a file or directory, just like copy pasting in a word document
7. find - helps you find the files you are looking for 
8. mv - lets you move a file or directory somewhere else
9. grep - like find but is looking for things INSIDE files rather than for the files themselves 
10. exit - tired of playing? You can head out of command line by typing exit and go back to solitaire.
